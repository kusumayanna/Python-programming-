    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- [] is an empty list in Python.\n",
    "- A list is an ordered, mutable collection of elements.\n",
    "- Square brackets are used both for defining lists and for indexing or slicing sequences.\n",

    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "List Concatenation (+):\n",
    "- The concatenation operator (+) is used to combine two or more lists into a single list.\n",
    "- It creates a new list that contains the elements of both lists in order, without modifying the original lists.\n",

    "- Purpose: Inserts an element at a specific position in the list.\n",
    "- Syntax: list.insert(index, element)\n",
    "- Effect: The element is added at the position specified by the index. All elements after the inserted element are shifted to the right.\n",
    "- eg:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- remove() when you know the value you want to remove and want to remove the first occurrence.\n",
    "- eg:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]\n",

    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- pop() when you want to remove an item by index, or when you want to remove and return the last item.\n",
    "- eg:\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "last_item = my_list.pop()\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\n",

    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "list values and string values share several similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Ordered Sequence:\n",
    "- Both lists and strings are ordered sequences of elements. \n",
    "This means that:\n",
    "  - The elements have a defined order.\n",
    "  - Each element can be accessed using an index.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "   List\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  String\n",
    "  my_string = \"abcd\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(my_list[2])  # Output: 3\n",
    "  print(my_string[2])  # Output: 'c'\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. Indexing:\n",
    "- Both lists and strings use zero-based indexing, meaning the first element is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  List\n",
    "  my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  String\n",
    "  my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  print(my_list[0])  # Output: 10\n",
    "  print(my_string[0])  # Output: 'h'\n",
    " \n",
    "3. Slicing:\n",
    "- Both lists and strings support slicing, which allows you to extract a sublist or substring by specifying a start and end index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  # List\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "  print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # String\n",
    "  my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "  print(my_string[1:4])  # Output: 'ell'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Iteration:\n",
    "- Both lists and strings can be iterated over using a `for` loop. \n",
    "- can loop through each element in both lists and strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  # List\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  for item in my_list:\n",

    "  \n",
    "  # String\n",
    "  my_string = \"abc\"\n",
    "  \n",
    "  for char in my_string:\n",
    "      print(char)  # Output: 'a' 'b' 'c'\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Concatenation:\n",
    "- You can concatenate both lists and strings using the `+` operator. \n",
    "- This combines two lists or two strings into one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  # List\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  new_list = my_list + [4, 5]\n",
    "  print(new_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # String\n",
    "  my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "  new_string = my_string + \" world\"\n",
    "  print(new_string)  # Output: \"hello world\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Repetition:\n",
    "- Both lists and strings support repetition using the `*` operator. \n",
    "- This repeats the elements of the list or string a specified number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  # List\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2]\n",
    "  repeated_list = my_list * 3\n",
    "  print(repeated_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # String\n",
    "  my_string = \"abc\"\n",
    "  repeated_string = my_string * 3\n",
    "  print(repeated_string)  # Output: 'abcabcabc'\n",
    " \n",
    "7 Length:\n",
    "- Both lists and strings have a length (i.e., the number of elements or characters). \n",
    "- can get the length using the `len()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # List\n",
    "  my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "  print(len(my_list))  # Output: 4\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # String\n",
    "  my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "  print(len(my_string))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Mutability:\n",
    "\n",
    "List (mutable)\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list[1] = 10  # This is allowed\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 10, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# String (immutable)\n",
    "my_string = \"hello\"\n",
    "# my_string[1] = 'a'  # This will raise an error: 'str' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mutability:\n",
    "   - Tuple: Immutable (cannot be modified).\n",
    "   - List: Mutable (can be modified).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Syntax:\n",
    "   - Tuple: Defined using parentheses `()`.\n",
    "   - List: Defined using square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Methods:\n",
    "   - Tuple: Fewer methods \n",
    "   - (e.g., `count()`, `index()`).\n",
    "   - List: More methods \n",
    "   - (e.g., `append()`, `remove()`, `pop()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance:\n",
    "   - Tuple: Faster for iteration and access due to immutability.\n",
    "   - List: Slightly slower due to mutability.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use Case:\n",
    "   - Tuple: For fixed collections of items \n",
    "   - (e.g., coordinates, fixed data).\n",
    "   - List: For dynamic collections of items \n",
    "   - (e.g., to-do lists, collections that change).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Size:\n",
    "   - Tuple: Fixed size after creation.\n",
    "   - List: Can grow or shrink.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Hashability:\n",
    "   - Tuple: Hashable (can be used as dictionary keys).\n",
    "   - List: Not hashable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "my_tuple = (42,)\n",
    "- To define a tuple with a single element, like 42, you need the trailing comma: (42,).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Converting a List to a Tuple:\n",
    "- To convert a list to a tuple, you can use the tuple() function.\n",

    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Variables contain references to the list, not the list itself.\n",
    "- If create another variable that points to the same list, both variables will reference the same memory location.\n",
    "- Modifying the list through one variable will affect all other variables that reference the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "1. copy.copy() (Shallow Copy):\n",
    "- What it does: Creates a shallow copy of an object, meaning it copies the outer object, but not the nested objects inside it. \n",
    "- The nested objects are still references to the original objects.\n",
    "- Use case: You would use copy.copy() when you want to copy an object but don't need to copy its nested objects. \n",
    "- Changes to the nested objects in the copy will affect the original.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import copy\n",
    "\n",
    "original = [1, [2, 3]]\n",

    "print(original)  # Output: [1, [99, 3]]\n",
    "print(shallow_copy)  # Output: [1, [99, 3]]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. copy.deepcopy() (Deep Copy):\n",
    "- What it does: Creates a deep copy of an object, meaning it copies not only the outer object but also all nested objects inside it. \n",
    "- Each object is recursively copied, so the original and the copy are completely independent, including their nested objects.\n",
    "- Use case: You would use copy.deepcopy() when you need to make a copy of an object and also ensure that all nested objects are copied, so changes in the copy don't affect the original.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import copy\n",

    "original = [1, [2, 3]]\n",
