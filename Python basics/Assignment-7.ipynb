    "1. Explain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (known as the derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (the base class). \n",
    "The derived class can reuse code from the base class and also extend or modify it, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it is used:\n",
    "- Code Reusability: Inheritance allows the derived class to use the methods and properties of the base class, reducing the need to write redundant code.\n",
    "- Extensibility: The derived class can add new features or modify existing behavior of the base class.\n",
    "- Maintainability: Changes made to the base class automatically propagate to the derived classes, which simplifies code maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Discuss the concept of single inheritance and multiple inheritance, highlighting their differences and advantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Inheritance occurs when a class can inherit from only one base class. \n",
    "- For example, in a `Car` class that inherits from a `Vehicle` class.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "  - Simplicity: It is easier to understand and manage since there's only one class being inherited from.\n",
    "  - Avoids ambiguity (conflicting method names or behaviors).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Multiple Inheritance occurs when a class can inherit from more than one base class. \n",
    "- For example, a `Smartphone` class inheriting from both `Phone` and `Camera` classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Advantages:\n",
    "  - Flexibility: A derived class can inherit attributes and methods from multiple sources.\n",
    "  - Code reuse is maximized since the class can inherit functionality from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Difference:\n",
    "  - Single inheritance is simpler but may limit flexibility.\n",
    "  - Multiple inheritance provides greater flexibility but may lead to issues like the diamond problem (conflicts when two base classes have the same method or attribute).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain the terms \"base class\" and \"derived class\" in the context of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Base Class (Parent Class): The class that provides properties and methods which are inherited by another class. \n",
    "- It is also known as the parent class. \n",
    "- For example, in the context of a `Vehicle` and `Car` relationship, `Vehicle` is the base class.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Derived Class (Child Class): The class that inherits from a base class. \n",
    "- It can use the properties and methods of the base class and can also have its own specific properties or methods. \n",
    "- In the `Vehicle` and `Car` relationship, `Car` is the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **protected** access modifier allows members (attributes or methods) to be accessible within the class itself and by subclasses (derived classes). \n",
    "- they are not accessible from outside the class or from non-derived classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Private: Members are accessible only within the class in which they are declared. \n",
    "- They are not accessible by derived classes or from outside the class.\n",
    "- Protected: Members are accessible within the class and any derived class. \n",
    "- They are not accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "- Public: Members are accessible from anywhere, both within the class, by derived classes, and from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "- The protected modifier is useful when you want to provide access to certain members to subclasses, but you donâ€™t want those members to be exposed to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the purpose of the \"super\" keyword in inheritance? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The `super` keyword is used to refer to the parent class or base class in a derived class. \n",
    "It can be used to call a method from the parent class or to access parent class properties that may have been overridden in the derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, fuel_type):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model)  # Calls the __init__ method of the Vehicle class\n",
    "        self.fuel_type = fuel_type\n",
    "\n",
    "car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", \"Petrol\")\n",
    "print(car.make, car.model, car.fuel_type)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `super().__init__(make, model)` calls the `__init__` method of the `Vehicle` class to initialize `make` and `model` in the `Car` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a base class called \"Vehicle\" with attributes like \"make\", \"model\", and \"year\". Then, create a derived class called \"Car\" that inherits from \"Vehicle\" and adds an attribute called \"fuel_type\". Implement appropriate methods in both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def display_info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year, fuel_type):\n",
    "        super().__init__(make, model, year)\n",
    "        self.fuel_type = fuel_type\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display_car_info(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.display_info()} - Fuel Type: {self.fuel_type}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example usage\n",
    "car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2021, \"Petrol\")\n",
    "print(car.display_car_info())\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Create a base class called \"Employee\" with attributes like \"name\" and \"salary\". Derive two classes, \"Manager\" and \"Developer,\" from \"Employee.\" Add an additional attribute called \"department\" for the \"Manager\" class and \"programming_language\" for the \"Developer\" class.\n",
