    "1.What is the difference between a built-in function and a user-defined function? Provide an example of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Built-in functions are functions that are provided by Python itself, without needing to define them. \n",
    "- Examples include functions like `len()`, `print()`, `sum()`, etc.\n",
    "- User-defined functions are functions that you create by yourself to perform specific tasks. \n",
    "- These are defined using the `def` keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a built-in function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the built-in function len()\n",
    "string = \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(len(string))  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a user-defined function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defining a user-defined function to add two numbers\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "print(add_numbers(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.How can you pass arguments to a function in Python? Explain the difference between positional arguments and keyword arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Positional arguments are arguments passed to a function in the order they are defined. \n",
    "- The first argument passed corresponds to the first parameter in the function definition.\n",
    "- Keyword arguments are passed to a function using the syntax `parameter=value`. \n",
    "- This allows you to specify the arguments by name, irrespective of their position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of positional arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "def greet(name, age):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello {name}, you are {age} years old.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(\"Alice\", 25)  # Output: Hello Alice, you are 25 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of keyword arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "greet(age=25, name=\"Alice\")  # Output: Hello Alice, you are 25 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3.What is the purpose of the return statement in a function? Can a function have multiple return statements? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- The `return` statement is used to exit a function and optionally pass a value back to the caller. \n",
    "- When the function executes a `return`, it stops executing further and sends the result back to the place where the function was called.\n",
    "- A function can have multiple return statements, often depending on conditions in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with multiple return statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "def check_number(num):\n",
    "    if num > 0:\n",
    "        return \"Positive\"\n",
    "    elif num < 0:\n",
    "        return \"Negative\"\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return \"Zero\"\n",
    "\n",
    "print(check_number(5))   # Output: Positive\n",
    "print(check_number(-3))  # Output: Negative\n",
    "print(check_number(0))   # Output: Zero\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.What are lambda functions in Python? How are they different from regular functions? Provide an example where a lambda function can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Lambda functions are anonymous, small functions defined using the `lambda` keyword. \n",
    "- They can have any number of arguments but only one expression. \n",
    "- They are typically used for short-term operations and are often passed as arguments to higher-order functions.\n",
    "- Regular functions are defined using the `def` keyword and can have multiple expressions, more complex logic, and can be reused across different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a lambda function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A simple lambda function to square a number\n",
    "square = lambda x: x ** 2\n",
    "print(square(4))  # Output: 16\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use case of lambda function:\n",
    "Lambda functions are often used with functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "- Using lambda with map to square each number in the list\n",
    "squared = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))\n",
    "print(squared)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.How does the concept of \"scope\" apply to functions in Python? Explain the difference between local scope and global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Scope in Python refers to the region in the program where a variable is accessible. \n",
    "- There are two main types of scope:\n",
    "  - Local scope refers to variables that are defined within a function. \n",
    "  - These variables are only accessible inside the function.\n",
    "  - Global scope refers to variables that are defined outside of any function, typically at the top level of a module. \n",
    "  - These variables are accessible throughout the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of local scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    local_var = 10  # local variable\n",
    "    print(local_var)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()  # Output: 10\n",
    "# print(local_var)  # This will raise an error because local_var is not accessible outside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of global scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "global_var = 20  # global variable\n",
    "\n",
    "def my_function():\n",
    "    print(global_var)  # Accessible within the function\n",
    "\n",
    "my_function()  # Output: 20\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6.How can you use the \"return\" statement in a Python function to return multiple values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "In Python, a function can return multiple values as a tuple. \n",
    "- simply separate the values with commas, and Python will automatically package them into a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "def get_coordinates():\n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "    y = 10\n",
    "    return x, y  # Returning multiple values as a tuple\n",
    "\n",
    "coords = get_coordinates()\n",
    "print(coords)  # Output: (5, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# can also unpack the returned tuple into separate variables:\n",
    "x, y = get_coordinates()\n",
    "print(x, y)  # Output: 5 10\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7.What is the difference between the \"pass by value\" and \"pass by reference\" concepts when it comes to function arguments in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Python's argument-passing mechanism is neither strictly pass-by-value nor pass-by-reference but rather a mechanism known as pass-by-object-reference (also called **pass-by-assignment).\n",
    "  - Immutable objects (e.g., integers, strings, tuples) behave like \"pass-by-value\" because their value cannot be changed within the function.\n",
    "  - Mutable objects (e.g., lists, dictionaries) behave like \"pass-by-reference\" because you can modify their contents within the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of immutable (pass-by-value-like behavior):\n",
    "\n",
    "def modify_number(x):\n",
    "    x = 10  # This doesn't affect the original value\n",
    "    print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "num = 5\n",
    "modify_number(num)\n",
    "print(num)  # Output: 5\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of mutable (pass-by-reference-like behavior):\n",
    "\n",
    "def modify_list(lst):\n",
    "    lst.append(4)  # This modifies the original list\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "modify_list(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Create a function that can intake integer or decimal value and do the following operations:\n",
    "- a. Logarithmic function (log x)\n",
    "- b. Exponential function (exp(x))\n",
    "- c. Power function with base 2 (2^x)\n",
    "- d. Square root\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",

    "\n",
    "def perform_operations(x):\n",
